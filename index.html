        <h1>The Enormous Nose</h1>
        <p id="para-1">ONCE A KING MADE THE UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE of joking about the large nose of an enchantress. Instantly the enchantress appeared before the King. Fixing her angry eyes on him and wagging her finger before his face, she said, "There will come a time when you will have a son. This child shall be born with an enormous nose,  a nose even bigger than your big mouth, a nose that will remain stuck upon his face until the moment he realizes what an ridiculous nose he indeed has."Home Â» The Enormous Nose <br>
            <img src="https://i0.wp.com/storiestogrowby.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/EN_Final1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1" alt="pic-1" height="350" width="750"> <br>
            <br>
        
           "If my son's nose is going to be as long as all that," the king thought to himself, "he would always see it or feel it - at least, if he is not blind or without hands. Certainly by the time he walks and talks he'll realize he has an unusually large nose. At that moment it will go away, if what this Enchantress says is true. This is no matter for concern."
            
            Soon the Queen had a little son and he was named Andre.
        
            Little Prince Andre had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas! his nose was so huge that it covered half his face. The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked.  They said with emphasis that it was a Roman nose, and you had only to open any history to see that every hero had a large nose. The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they told her.  When she looked at baby Andre again, his nose did not seem to her quite so large.
            
            The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose.
            
            The Prince was brought up with great care. As soon as he could speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had short noses. No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more or less resemble his own. The courtiers, to get into favor with the Queen, took to pulling their noses several times every day to make them grow longer. But, do what they would, their noses were nothing in comparison with the Prince's.
            
            When he grew older he learned history. Whenever any great prince or princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him that they had very long noses. His room was hung with pictures, all of people with large noses. The Prince grew up convinced that a long nose was a feature of great beauty.</p>

        <h1>Beauty and the Beast</h1>
        <p id="para-2">ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters.  Being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful but the first two daughters cared little about their learning.  The youngest was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her, but this she hardly noticed as she was forever absorbed in one good book or another. 

            The two elder sisters had a great deal of pride because they were rich. <br>

            They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any persons but those of the highest standing. They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister who spent so much of her time with a book in front of her face. One day the merchant learned terrible news - his ship that had on board hundreds of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, was lost at sea.  Overnight, his entire fortune vanished!

            The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.  The merchant told his children with tears in his eyes that they must live there and work for their living. The two older daughters answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to marry them, though they no longer had a fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said: They do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled.  Let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their chickens, like the rest of us. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty.  She is such a sweet-tempered creature who speaks kindly to everyone rich or poor, and has such a friendly, gracious nature.
            
            The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.
            
            When the family moved to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming. Beauty rose at four in the morning before the others awoke and made haste to light the fire, clean the house, and prepare breakfast for the family. In the beginning she found the work very difficult for she was not used to this sort of hard labor.  But in less than two months, she grew stronger and healthier than ever. After she had done her chores, Beauty read a book, played the harpsichord, or sung while she spun yarn.
            
            Her two sisters, on the other hand, did not know how to spend their time. They got up at ten and did nothing but saunter about the whole day, lamenting the loss of their fine clothes and acquaintances. "Look at our youngest sister," they snickered to each other. "See how well-suited she is to a life of menial labor."</p>
